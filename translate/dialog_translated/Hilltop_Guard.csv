69483,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"Sorry, but I can't chat right now. There's only a few of us left after that attack and the mayor wants us on double-duty... just in case.","미안하지만 지금은 얘기할 수 없어. 그 습격 후로 남은 경비가 몇 명 없어서 촌장이 만일에 대비해 이중 근무를 시키고 있거든.",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69484,Creature,Hilltop Guard,It might be safer if you went back to the school. There's only a few of us guards left right now to watch for any more attacks.,"학교로 돌아가는 게 더 안전할 거야. 지금은 추가 습격에 대비할 경비가 몇 명 안 남았거든.",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69485,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"You be careful, <FirstName>. There's no way to be sure all the kobolds are gone, and more could arrive.","조심해, <FirstName>. 코볼트가 전부 사라졌는지 확신할 수 없고, 더 올 수도 있어.",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69486,Creature,Hilltop Guard,<FirstName>? Is everything alright at the school? How is Drogan doing?,"<FirstName>? 학교는 괜찮아? 드로건은 어때?",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69487,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"What are you doing here? I'm watching you, <FirstName>, just so you know.","여기서 뭐 하는 거야? 지켜보고 있으니까 알아둬, <FirstName>.",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69488,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"Shouldn't you be back at your school? Drogan's there, isn't he? How is he doing?","학교로 돌아가야 하는 거 아냐? 드로건이 거기 있잖아? 어떻게 지내?",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69489,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"I don't want any trouble out of you, <FirstName>. We've got enough problems in Hilltop right now.","너 때문에 문제 생기는 건 싫어, <FirstName>. 힐탑에 지금 문제가 충분히 많거든.",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69490,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"Eh? Err... no, not this second. I have to watch for the reinforcements to arrive from Silverymoon. How about you? Everything okay with Drogan?","응? 어... 아니, 지금은 안 돼. 실버리문에서 오는 지원군을 기다려야 해. 너는 어때? 드로건은 괜찮아?",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69491,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"And more than any of us need right now. There were plenty of people hurt by the kobolds, not that you'd care.","지금 우리한테 필요한 건 훨씬 더 많아. 코볼트 때문에 다친 사람이 많은데, 네가 신경이나 쓰겠냐만.",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69492,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"Hmph. I don't know what Drogan sees in you. Well, do what you like. I have other things to worry about.","흥. 드로건이 너한테서 뭘 보는지 모르겠네. 뭐, 하고 싶은 대로 해. 난 걱정할 게 더 있거든.",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69493,Creature,Hilltop Guard,Oh? Everything okay at the school? Drogan is alright?,"오? 학교는 괜찮아? 드로건은 무사해?",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69494,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"I've heard enough about your exploits, <FirstName>. Just watch it, that's all.","네 행적에 대해 많이 들었어, <FirstName>. 그냥 조심해, 그게 다야.",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69495,Creature,Hilltop Guard,Well... maybe I'm being a bit harsh. I've just heard stories about you.,"글쎄... 내가 좀 심하게 굴었나. 네 얘기를 들었거든.",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69496,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"It's good to see you, <FirstName>. Something I can help you with?","만나서 반가워, <FirstName>. 도와줄 일이 있어?",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69497,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"You be careful there, <FirstName>. We're not certain all the kobolds are gone from Hilltop just yet.","조심해, <FirstName>. 힐탑에서 코볼트가 전부 사라졌는지 아직 확실하지 않아.",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69498,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"It's good to see that you're okay, <FirstName>. We were worried about you and Drogan up at the school. How is Drogan doing?","무사해서 다행이야, <FirstName>. 학교에 있는 너와 드로건이 걱정됐어. 드로건은 어때?",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69499,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"Oh. I, ah... hope the old dwarf is alright, anyway. Those kobolds took us by surprise.","아. 나, 어... 어쨌든 그 늙은 드워프가 괜찮으면 좋겠네. 코볼트 놈들이 기습했거든.",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0

69501,Creature,Hilltop Guard,Be careful.,"조심해.",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69502,Creature,Hilltop Guard,Farghan's in his shop across from the tavern. But what am I saying? Of course you know where his shop is.,"파르간은 여관 건너편 가게에 있어. 근데 내가 왜 이러지? 당연히 가게가 어딘지 알잖아.",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69503,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"Not personally, no. Fiona's in her smithy, however... I'm sure she can supply you whatever equipment you need at a decent price.","개인적으로는 없어. 하지만 피오나가 대장간에 있어... 적당한 가격에 필요한 장비를 뭐든 구해줄 수 있을 거야.",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69504,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"I can't. The mayor wants the few of us that are left watching out for any new attacks. When we get reinforcements from Silverymoon, we'll do a house-to-house search.","안 돼. 촌장이 남은 우리 몇 명을 새로운 습격에 대비시키고 있거든. 실버리문에서 지원군이 오면 집집이 수색할 거야.",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69505,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"Yes. We've already sent out a messenger to them, asking for help. Hopefully they weren't attacked as well.","응. 이미 전령을 보내서 도움을 요청했어. 그쪽도 공격받지 않았으면 좋겠네.",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69506,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"The ones that ran away? They went south, by way of the town gate. You intend on chasing after them? If so, they've got quite a head start on you.","도망친 놈들? 마을 문 쪽으로 남쪽으로 갔어. 뒤쫓을 생각이야? 그렇다면 꽤 앞서 있을 거야.",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69507,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"So they must have killed her right after they escaped. That's a sad, sad shame. Thank you for telling me... I'll let everyone know.","그럼 탈출하자마자 그녀를 죽인 거네. 정말 안타까운 일이야. 알려줘서 고마워... 모두에게 전할게.",Q1BGUARD,q1b_toldmara,,,,0,0
69508,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"They did? But... I thought Lodar reported that he had everything under control there, short of a stand-off with a few kobolds in the kitchen.","그랬어? 하지만... 로다르가 부엌에서 코볼트 몇 마리와 대치하는 것 빼고는 다 통제했다고 보고하지 않았어?",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69509,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"Blast! The mayor should have let us go and help those poor souls. Ahhh, well... thank you for bringing me the news, <FirstName>, bad as it is.","젠장! 촌장이 우리를 보내서 그 불쌍한 사람들을 도왔어야 해. 아아, 뭐... 소식 전해줘서 고마워, <FirstName>, 나쁜 소식이지만.",Q1BGUARD,q1b_lieguard02,,,,0,0
69510,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"Well, you might want to talk to Haniah over at the town hall. I heard the mayor's so drunk he can barely stand... so she's got her hands full, I bet.","글쎄, 마을 회관에 있는 하니아와 얘기해 보는 게 좋을 거야. 촌장이 너무 취해서 제대로 서지도 못한다던데... 그녀가 정신없이 바쁠 거야.",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69511,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"Beyond that, if you could check around to make sure the kobolds aren't still bothering the locals, we'd appreciate it.","그 외에도 코볼트들이 아직 주민들을 괴롭히고 있는지 확인해 줄 수 있으면 고맙겠어.",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69512,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"I'd gladly do that myself, but as long as we're this short-handed none of us can spare the time from keeping watch before help arrives.","기꺼이 내가 직접 하겠지만 이렇게 인원이 부족하면 지원이 올 때까지 감시에서 손 뗄 수가 없어.",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69513,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"That's a relief. It's always been a point of pride amongst the people here that we have our own resident wizard, you know.","다행이네. 여기 사람들 사이에서 우리 마을에 마법사가 있다는 게 항상 자랑거리였거든.",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69514,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"Damnable reptiles! Took us by surprise, they did. I hope Drogan recovers. If he died, that would be a real loss for all of us.","빌어먹을 파충류 놈들! 기습당했어. 드로건이 회복하면 좋겠어. 돌아가시면 우리 모두에게 큰 손실이야.",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69515,Creature,Hilltop Guard,Poisoned? Then you'd best get to Farghan's as soon as possible. He was in his shop the last I saw.,"독에 당했다고? 그럼 빨리 파르간한테 가는 게 좋겠어. 마지막으로 봤을 때 가게에 있었어.",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69516,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"That's good to hear. Thank you for letting me know, I'll pass it on.","다행이네. 알려줘서 고마워, 전해줄게.",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69517,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"I wish we could have. We were taken by surprise and had our own battles to fight. We lost several men, I'm afraid to say.","그러고 싶었어. 기습당해서 우리도 싸워야 했거든. 안타깝게도 몇 명을 잃었어.",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
69518,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"I can't say that killing Piper was the right thing to do, but I guess it's on your conscience now, isn't it?","파이퍼를 죽인 게 옳은 일이라고는 못 하겠지만 이제 네 양심에 달린 일이잖아, 안 그래?",Q1BGUARD,act_q1bkillpiper,,,,0,0
69519,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"So you killed Piper, did you, <FirstName>? I can't say it wasn't coming for him, all things considered.","그래서 파이퍼를 죽였구나, <FirstName>? 뭐, 자업자득이라면 자업자득이지.",Q1BGUARD,act_q1bkillpiper,,,,0,0
69520,Creature,Hilltop Guard,"I cannot believe that Blumberg is burnt to the ground. I sure am glad we were better defended. You did a good thing, rescuing those refugees.","블럼버그가 잿더미가 됐다니 믿을 수가 없어. 우리가 더 잘 방어된 게 다행이야. 피난민들을 구출한 건 잘한 일이야.",Q1BGUARD,,,,,0,0
