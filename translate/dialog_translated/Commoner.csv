15684,Creature,Commoner,I would hate to think that the times have turned a person of your stature to banditry. Why are you in my home?,세상이 이렇게 됐다고 너 같은 사람이 도둑질까지 하게 됐다고는 믿고 싶지 않아. 내 집에 왜 들어왔지?,M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15685,Creature,Commoner,Who are you? Why are you in my home? I don't want to think my fellow Neverwintans would stoop to banditry.,넌 누구야? 왜 내 집에 들어왔지? 같은 네버윈터 사람들이 도둑질까지 한다고는 생각하고 싶지 않아.,M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15686,Creature,Commoner,Must I worry about bandits as well as the plague? Give me a reason you are in my home or get out!,역병도 모자라 도둑까지 걱정해야 하나? 내 집에 들어온 이유를 대거나 당장 나가!,M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15687,Creature,Commoner,"Obviously they have lowered their expectations for new guards. If you can form questions, please ask them and leave.",새로 뽑는 경비대 수준을 확 낮췄나 보군. 물을 게 있으면 묻고 나가.,M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15688,Creature,Commoner,"I see. I had heard they were recruiting from outside the city. Very well, I will speak with you. I trust this will be brief?","그래. 도시 밖에서까지 사람을 끌어온다더니. 좋아, 얘기해 주지. 오래 걸리진 않겠지?",M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15689,Creature,Commoner,Not much. There's very little that I need to know except that it kills my friends and family.,별로. 내 친구랑 가족을 죽인다는 것 말고 알아야 할 게 뭐가 있겠어.,M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15690,Creature,Commoner,Lord Nasher assures us that all efforts are being made to find a cure. Beyond that... I haven't heard anything.,나셰르 영주님이 치료법을 찾기 위해 모든 노력을 다하고 있다고는 하더군. 그 말고는... 들은 게 없어.,M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15691,Creature,Commoner,Farewell. Please leave my home as you found it.,그럼 잘 가. 들어왔을 때 그대로 두고 나가.,M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15692,Creature,Commoner,What is it you want to know? I am sure you would get better answers from your fellow guards. I am a simple citizen.,뭘 알고 싶은데? 같은 경비들에게 묻는 게 더 낫겠지. 난 그냥 평범한 시민이야.,M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15693,Creature,Commoner,"I can't say much. I live and work in the City Core. The Blacklake district is beyond my means, and I certainly have no business in the others.","아는 게 많지 않아. 난 도시 중심부에서 살며 일하거든. 검은호수 지구는 감히 넘볼 형편이 아니고, 다른 지구엔 볼일도 없지.",M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15694,Creature,Commoner,"I don't bother with the Beggar's Nest, the Docks, or the Peninsula. They were rough enough before the Wailing took hold.",거지 소굴이니 항만이니 반도 지구니... 거긴 관심도 없어. '울부짖는 죽음 역병'이 퍼지기 전부터 험악했거든.,M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15695,Creature,Commoner,"Sorry, I really don't get out of the City Core much. Especially now with the plague everywhere. It's just not safe.",미안하지만 난 도시 중심부 밖으로 잘 안 나가. 특히 지금처럼 역병이 창궐할 땐 더더욱. 안전하지가 않아.,M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15696,Creature,Commoner,"That is where you are now. It is the business center of the city. Really, this should all be evident to you after just walking around.",지금 네가 있는 곳이 거기야. 도시의 상업 중심이지. 솔직히 좀만 돌아다녀도 알 만한 거잖아.,M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15697,Creature,Commoner,Home to the slums. The Beggar's Nest was poor enough before the Wailing. I don't want to think about what it would be like now.,빈민가가 모여 있는 곳. 거지 소굴은 '울부짖는 죽음 역병' 전에도 충분히 비참했어. 지금은 상상도 하기 싫다.,M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0

15699,Creature,Commoner,I see no reason to answer. You invaded my home and haven't offered any explanation why. Just get out.,대답할 이유가 없네. 내 집에 들어와 놓고 이유도 못 대잖아. 그냥 나가.,M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15700,Creature,Commoner,"Well, it appears there is very little I can do to prevent you doing what you wish. Does this mean you intend to rob my home?",보아하니 네가 하겠단 걸 막을 방법은 없나 보군. 그러니까 내 집을 털겠다는 건가?,M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15702,Creature,Commoner,"You again? I'm sorry, but is there really a reason for you to remain in my home?","또 너야? 미안한데, 정말 내 집에 더 있을 이유가 있나?",M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15703,Creature,Commoner,"Hmph. Outsiders hired to replace our dead. I suppose they expect me to trust you? I'll answer a few questions, but then you should leave.",흥. 죽은 사람들 대신 외부인을 끌어오는군. 우리가 그런 너희를 믿길 바라는 건가? 몇 가지만 답하겠다. 그다음엔 나가.,M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15704,Creature,Commoner,I can't tell you anything about the place. I've been lucky enough to save a few coins here and there.,그쪽 사정은 몰라. 난 여기저기서 겨우 푼돈이나 모으는 처지야.,M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15705,Creature,Commoner,"I don't know much about it. I try to stay away from the rougher areas of the city. I hear talk about pirates, but I wouldn't know.","잘 몰라. 난 도시에서 험한 동네는 피하는 편이거든. 해적 얘기는 들었지만, 자세한 건 몰라.",M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15706,Creature,Commoner,The Blacklake district is the wealthiest part of the city. I don't have much cause to go there. I can't afford to look like I belong there.,"검은호수 지구는 이 도시에서 제일 부유한 동네야. 갈 일도 없고, 거기에 어울릴 차림을 할 돈도 없어.",M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15707,Creature,Commoner,I've got no reason to know anything about the Peninsula district. Only the roughest of our criminal element end up there.,반도 지구에 대해 알 이유가 없지. 가장 악질 범죄자들이나 끌려가는 곳이니까.,M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15708,Creature,Commoner,"It's worse than the Docks, I hear. I've never been there, though.",항만보다도 더 험하단 얘기는 들었어. 난 가 본 적 없지만.,M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0

15710,Creature,Commoner,"I don't pay much attention to politics. I follow Lord Nasher as our leader, and Lady Aribeth of the Neverwinter Nine.","정치엔 별 관심 없어. 우린 지도자로 나셰르 영주님을 따르고, 네버윈터 9인회의 아리베스 경을 믿지.",M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15711,Creature,Commoner,"Lord Nasher has pledged any needed resources to curing the plague. He has been quite supportive, as any leader would when tragedy strikes.",나셰르 영주님은 역병 치료에 필요한 자원을 전부 투입하겠다고 약속했어. 비극이 닥치면 당연히 그래야지.,M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15712,Creature,Commoner,"Actually, I should say that it was his advisors that made his intentions known. Lord Nasher himself has wisely been locked away to protect against the plague.",정확히는 참모들이 대신 뜻을 밝힌 거지만. 나셰르 영주님 본인은 역병을 피하려고 성에 머무는 게 현명하니까.,M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15713,Creature,Commoner,"Now, are we just about done? You are still in my home uninvited.",이제 다 됐나? 넌 아직도 초대받지 않고 내 집에 있거든.,M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15714,Creature,Commoner,"I don't know any specifics, but she has been on the front lines of everything, working with people, trying to organize.","자세한 건 몰라도, 아리베스 경은 최전선에서 사람들과 함께 일하고, 조직을 정비하고 있지.",M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15715,Creature,Commoner,"The only people we see more are the Helmites, dispensing their blessings. I'm not sure who they report to. Someone under Aribeth?","그보다 자주 보이는 건 헬름의 사제들이야. 축복을 베푼다나. 누구 지휘를 받는진 모르겠는데, 아리베스 경 쪽이겠지?",M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15716,Creature,Commoner,Does that suffice? Do you have more questions or will you leave my home now?,"이 정도면 됐지? 더 묻겠다면 몰라도, 이제 내 집에서 나가 줄래?",M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15717,Creature,Commoner,"I've heard of an increase in banditry, which is why I'd like you to leave my home.",도둑질이 늘었다더군. 그러니 제발 내 집에서 나가 줘.,M1Q1A00COM1,,,,,0,0
15757,Creature,Commoner,"May I assist you? I don't want to be rude, but you *are* in my home uninvited.","무슨 일로 왔지? 무례하게 굴긴 싫지만, 넌 초대 없이 내 집에 들어왔어.",M1Q1A00COM2,,,,,0,0

15762,Creature,Commoner,The Helmites claim their blessings are a cure. I don't know. Everyday I see a few less of my neighbors around.,"헬름의 사제들은 자기 축복이 치료라는데, 난 모르겠어. 날이 갈수록 이웃이 하나둘씩 사라지기만 하니까.",M1Q1A00COM2,,,,,0,0

15766,Creature,Commoner,"There's the Beggar's Nest, the Docks, the Peninsula, and Blacklake. I guess I could say something about them.","거지 소굴, 항만, 반도 지구, 검은호수. 그 정도 얘긴 해 줄 수 있겠네.",M1Q1A00COM2,,,,,0,0
15767,Creature,Commoner,Not really. All I hear of is the plague and the death. It's almost too much. I don't want to know if there's anything else going on.,"아니. 들리는 건 역병이랑 죽음뿐이야. 너무 버겁다 보니, 다른 일은 알기도 싫어.",M1Q1A00COM2,,,,,0,0
15768,Creature,Commoner,Why? That's where you are now. Couldn't you just walk around? Did you have to break into my home to learn that?,"왜? 지금 네가 있는 데가 거기야. 조금만 돌아다녀도 알 텐데, 굳이 내 집을 털어가며 물어야 했니?",M1Q1A00COM2,,,,,0,0
15769,Creature,Commoner,"It's the poorest district. I don't give it much thought, really. Makes me feel bad, especially with it hit so hard by the Wailing.",제일 가난한 지구지. 생각하려고도 안 해. 특히 '울부짖는 죽음 역병'으로 제일 크게 맞았으니까.,M1Q1A00COM2,,,,,0,0
