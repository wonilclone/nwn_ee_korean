70952,Creature,Toman Bross,Hey! Leave my stuff alone! Stop you thief!,이봐! 내 물건에서 손 떼! 멈춰 이 도둑놈아!,Q1HOUSEGUY,,,,,0,0
70953,Creature,Toman Bross,"Get out of my hovel, you beasts! Leave me alone! Oh, it's just you, <FirstName>. When my locked door suddenly opened, I thought the kobolds were back.","내 오두막에서 나가, 이 짐승들아! 날 내버려 둬! 아, <FirstName>이구나. 잠긴 문이 갑자기 열리니까 코볼트들이 돌아온 줄 알았어.",Q1HOUSEGUY,,,,,0,0
70954,Creature,Toman Bross,"If you are hunting kobolds, there's none in here. THEY got the point when they found the door locked and left. Just goes to show, I suppose. So, is the fighting done?","코볼트를 사냥하는 거라면, 여기엔 없어. 놈들은 문이 잠겨 있는 걸 보고 알아서 갔거든. 그럴 줄 알았지. 그래서, 싸움은 끝났어?",Q1HOUSEGUY,act_q1houseguy5,,,,0,0
70955,Creature,Toman Bross,"Lousy, snooping adventurers; always going into other people's homes and stealing their stuff.","빌어먹을, 기웃거리는 모험가들이란. 항상 남의 집에 들어가서 물건을 훔치지.",Q1HOUSEGUY,,,,,0,0
70956,Creature,Toman Bross,"Oh, right then. I think I will. Just to be safe.","아, 그래. 그렇게 할게. 안전을 위해서.",Q1HOUSEGUY,,,,,0,0
70957,Creature,Toman Bross,What ever. Just be gone.,뭐 어쨌든. 그냥 가버려.,Q1HOUSEGUY,,,,,0,0
70958,Creature,Toman Bross,"You bashed down my door, so I have nothing to stop any other hungry monsters from wandering into my house and having a little Toman snack, and now you just want to chat a little? Hmm?","내 문을 부쉈으니까 배고픈 괴물들이 내 집에 들어와서 토만 간식을 먹는 걸 막을 게 없는데, 이제 그냥 잡담하자고? 응?",Q1HOUSEGUY,,,,,0,0
70959,Creature,Toman Bross,"Anything else, or has the stench of my poverty finally driven you off?","다른 건 없어, 아니면 내 가난의 악취가 드디어 널 쫓아낸 거야?",Q1HOUSEGUY,,,,,0,0
70960,Creature,Toman Bross,"I suppose so, if you really want to. I imagine it might cost me two gold pieces to replace it, though it did need replacing anyways. The wood was getting a little soft.","정말 원한다면 그렇게 할게. 교체하는 데 금화 두 개쯤 들겠지만, 어차피 교체가 필요하긴 했어. 나무가 좀 물러지고 있었거든.",Q1HOUSEGUY,,,,,0,0
70961,Creature,Toman Bross,"Oh, never mind. I know where there's a little abandoned cabin, not too far from here. I can just take the door off of it. It's in better shape than mine was anyways. What do you want?","아, 됐어. 여기서 멀지 않은 곳에 작은 버려진 오두막이 있는 걸 알아. 거기서 문을 떼어오면 돼. 어차피 내 것보다 상태가 좋거든. 뭘 원해?",Q1HOUSEGUY,,,,,0,0
70962,Creature,Toman Bross,"Nothing much recently, unless you include the Red Wizard who came to town. I tremble at the thought of those Thayvians coming here. Evil folk they are.","최근엔 별일 없어, 마을에 온 붉은 마법사를 빼면. 저 테이인들이 여기 온다는 생각에 떨리네. 사악한 놈들이야.",Q1HOUSEGUY,,,,,0,0
70963,Creature,Toman Bross,"Last I heard, the mayor and his assistant were going to throw him out of town. I don't know what happened though, the kobolds attacked before he got an audience with the mayor.","마지막으로 들은 바로는, 시장과 보좌관이 그를 마을에서 쫓아낼 거라더라. 무슨 일이 있었는지는 모르겠어, 그가 시장과 만나기 전에 코볼트들이 공격했거든.",Q1HOUSEGUY,,,,,0,0
70964,Creature,Toman Bross,"My guess is he'll be headed out of town. Good riddance and none too soon if you ask me! Other than that, there's the halfling caravan and that's about all I know.","내 생각엔 그가 마을을 떠날 거야. 내가 보기엔 잘 됐고 빨리 떠날수록 좋아! 그 외에는 하플링 대상이 있고 내가 아는 건 그게 다야.",Q1HOUSEGUY,,,,,0,0
70965,Creature,Toman Bross,"Little thieves, that's what they are! Good thing I don't have nothing for them to steal. I have kept my distance, just in case though. I don't know why they're here.","작은 도둑놈들, 그게 그들이야! 다행히 내겐 훔칠 게 없어. 혹시 모르니까 거리를 뒀지. 왜 여기 있는지 모르겠어.",Q1HOUSEGUY,,,,,0,0
70966,Creature,Toman Bross,"I think you would get along with them. You could pick each other's pockets and locks and all that sort of nonsense. For a man like me, I avoid getting to close, just in case.","난 네가 그들과 잘 어울릴 것 같아. 서로의 주머니와 자물쇠를 따고 그런 헛짓거리를 할 수 있겠지. 나 같은 사람은 혹시 모르니까 가까이 가지 않아.",Q1HOUSEGUY,,,,,0,0
70967,Creature,Toman Bross,"Well, they look a fair bit like you, which makes sense I suppose. I have kept my distance from them, since some around here claim they're just a bunch of thieves anyways.","글쎄, 그들은 너와 꽤 비슷하게 생겼는데, 당연한 것 같아. 여기 사람들 중 일부가 그들은 그냥 도둑떼라고 주장하니까 거리를 뒀어.",Q1HOUSEGUY,,,,,0,0
70968,Creature,Toman Bross,"I don't know anything more about them, but you can go speak to them if you wish. Their caravan is right down the road from here. Anything else?","그들에 대해 더 아는 건 없어, 하지만 원하면 가서 말해봐. 그들 대상은 여기서 길 아래에 있어. 다른 건?",Q1HOUSEGUY,,,,,0,0
70969,Creature,Toman Bross,<StartCheck>[Failure]</Start> You are such a bad liar. You just came here to rob me. So why don't you go ahead and do that? I don't have hardly anything other than this hovel.,<StartCheck>[실패]</Start> 넌 정말 거짓말을 못하는구나. 그냥 날 털러 온 거잖아. 그러니까 그냥 해버리지 그래? 이 오두막 말고는 거의 가진 게 없어.,Q1HOUSEGUY,,,,,0,0
70970,Creature,Toman Bross,Maybe you should just kill me and loot my home! Maybe you'll even find a couple of silver pieces! ,그냥 날 죽이고 내 집을 털지 그래! 은화 몇 개쯤은 찾을 수 있을 거야!,Q1HOUSEGUY,,,,,0,0
70971,Creature,Toman Bross,"Uh... oh, you wouldn't really do that would you? I don't want to die. But I really am poor. I am just a little overwrought, what with the attack and all. Any other questions?","어... 아, 진짜 그러진 않겠지? 죽고 싶지 않아. 하지만 진짜 가난해. 공격 때문에 좀 흥분했을 뿐이야. 다른 질문 있어?",Q1HOUSEGUY,,,,,0,0
70972,Creature,Toman Bross,<StartCheck>[Success]</Start> It's about time somebody did something to protect us poor citizens. I'm glad to hear the mayor is taking steps.,<StartCheck>[성공]</Start> 누군가 우리 가난한 시민들을 보호하기 위해 뭔가 할 때가 됐지. 시장이 조치를 취하고 있다니 기쁘네.,Q1HOUSEGUY,,,,,0,0
70973,Creature,Toman Bross,"Here is my gold piece. That's all I have left. Took me a year to save up that much, but I am happy to part with it, if it goes towards saving my life.","여기 내 금화야. 이게 남은 전부야. 이만큼 모으는 데 1년이 걸렸지만, 내 목숨을 구하는 데 쓰인다면 기꺼이 내놓을게.",Q1HOUSEGUY,act_q1houseguy3,,,,0,0

70976,Creature,Toman Bross,"Well, I should hope not! Is there anything else?","글쎄, 아니길 바라야지! 다른 건 없어?",Q1HOUSEGUY,,,,,0,0
70977,Creature,Toman Bross,Right across the road. Look for the sign that says 'Blacksmith'. How hard can this be?,길 바로 건너편이야. '대장간'이라고 쓰인 간판을 찾아. 이게 얼마나 어렵다고?,Q1HOUSEGUY,,,,,0,0
70978,Creature,Toman Bross,"Right across the road. Look for the sign that says 'Herbalist', unless Drogan never taught you to read.","길 바로 건너편이야. '약초상'이라고 쓰인 간판을 찾아, 드로건이 글 읽는 법을 안 가르쳐줬으면 모를까.",Q1HOUSEGUY,,,,,0,0

70981,Creature,Toman Bross,"You picked the lock to my door so you could loot my hovel, probably broke the lock too, and now you just want to have a little chat? Hmm?","내 오두막을 털려고 내 문 자물쇠를 땄고, 아마 자물쇠도 부쉈을 텐데, 이제 그냥 잡담하자고? 응?",Q1HOUSEGUY,,,,,0,0
70982,Creature,Toman Bross,"<StartCheck>[Failure]</Start> Hey, don't you threaten me. I'm good friends with the mayor and I'm on speaking terms with Drogan.

70985,Creature,Toman Bross,"I... I guess I can give you my gold piece. That's all I have though. I would threaten to tell Drogan, but I guess you would hurt me if I did.
