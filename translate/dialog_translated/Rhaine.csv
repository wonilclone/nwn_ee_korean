28450,Creature,Rhaine,"All he thinks about is killing Baram and taking over the city, talking about how glorious it will be. I don't believe he even actually thinks about what all of this has done to Luskan.","그가 생각하는 건 바람을 죽이고 도시를 차지하는 것뿐이에요. 얼마나 영광스러울지 떠들어대죠. 이게 러스칸을 어떻게 망쳤는지는 생각도 안 하는 것 같아요.",2Q4C_RHAINE,,,,,0,0

28456,Creature,Rhaine,Kurth is in the West Docks district. His men come out of a gap broken in the wall. I don't suggest that you use that. There is an opening in the ruins of his old tower. It's what I use when I must go and see him.,"커스는 서부 항구 지구에 있어요. 부하들은 벽에 뚫린 틈으로 드나드는데, 거긴 추천하지 않아요. 옛 탑 폐허에 다른 입구가 있어요. 제가 그를 만나러 갈 때 쓰는 곳이에요.",2Q4C_RHAINE,2q4_orethjour,,,,0,0
