Epic spells are neither considered arcane, nor divine, thus all spellcasting classes capable of casting 9th level spells can learn how to cast them.

Each epic spell known to a character can be cast only once per day.

For a list and description of epic spells available in Hordes of the Underdark, please refer to your manual.","초월적 주문시전자는 마법이 실제로 어떻게 작동하는지 이해하기 시작합니다. 강력한 지성, 방대한 지혜, 또는 순수한 성격의 힘을 적용하여 주문시전자는 우주적이고 개인적인 에너지를 직접 조작할 수 있습니다. 초월적 주문은 비전도 신성도 아닌 것으로 간주되므로, 9레벨 주문을 시전할 수 있는 모든 주문시전 직업이 시전하는 법을 배울 수 있습니다.
