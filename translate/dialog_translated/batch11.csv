Pony was not a gifted being, but he managed to sew the cloak in a matter of just a few days. Barely resembling a cloak, Pony Tall had done the best he could and so wrapped the tattered garment up and made way to his master.

After giving the cloak to the King, Pony was slaughtered for his foul gift, his blood staining and possibly corrupting the garment.

Before tossing the cloak out along with Pony's body, King Richard put it on to mock his dead, incompetant servant. Upon doing so, he felt better - in all ways - and the cold night air ceased.

It was never known how the cloak came to have the powers it has, but most suspect they actually originated from his dead servant's blood.","이 망토의 기원은 리처드 개리슨 왕이 카니아에서 권력을 쥐고 있던 시절로 거슬러 올라갑니다. 그의 하인인 포니 톨이라는 정신 나가고 뒤틀린 남자가 왕을 위해 만들었습니다.

포니는 재능 있는 존재가 아니었지만, 불과 며칠 만에 망토를 꿰맸습니다. 망토라고 하기 어려운 모양이었지만, 포니 톨은 최선을 다했기에 너덜너덜한 옷을 싸서 주인에게로 향했습니다.

망토를 왕에게 준 후, 포니는 그 형편없는 선물 때문에 도살당했고, 그의 피가 옷을 물들이고 아마도 타락시켰을 것입니다.

포니의 시체와 함께 망토를 버리기 전에, 리처드 왕은 죽은 무능한 하인을 조롱하기 위해 입어보았습니다. 그러자 그는 모든 면에서 기분이 나아졌고 - 차가운 밤공기도 사라졌습니다.

107972,,,"When constructing golems, it is important not to forget the importance of adding enhancements through enchantments. The easiest way to accomplish this is to include spell conduits on your golem creation machine. These conduits can then be filled with the appropriate spells.

It is important to remember that the effects of spells can be altered during the creation process, often producing an unexpected result when they are passed through the spell conduit.

For example:
1. Greater Spell Mantle will improve a golem's resistance to magic.
2. Bigby's Crushing Hand increases a golem's strength.
3. Greater Sanctuary provides more protection against physical attacks.
4. Time Stop grants the golem improved regenaration.
5. Premonition results in improved damage reduction.
6. Mass Haste provides a permanent haste effect.
7. True Seeing provides a permanent True Seeing effect.
8. Chain Lightning causes a lightning bolt to be released whenever the golem is hit by an enemy.
9. Mordenkainen's Disjuntion gives the golem the ability to Dispel Magic each time it hits an opponent.

By placing these spells in the respective conduits, a golem's attributes and abilities can be customized to the creators exact specifications.

Alsigard the Maker","골렘을 제작할 때, 마법 부여를 통해 강화를 추가하는 것의 중요성을 잊지 말아야 합니다. 이를 가장 쉽게 달성하는 방법은 골렘 제작 기계에 주문 도관을 포함시키는 것입니다. 이 도관에 적절한 주문을 채울 수 있습니다.

주문의 효과는 제작 과정에서 변경될 수 있으며, 주문 도관을 통과할 때 종종 예상치 못한 결과를 생성한다는 점을 기억하는 것이 중요합니다.

예를 들어:
1. 상급 주문 장막은 골렘의 마법 저항력을 높입니다.
2. 비그비의 분쇄 손은 골렘의 힘을 증가시킵니다.
3. 상급 성역은 물리 공격에 대한 보호를 더 제공합니다.
4. 시간 정지는 골렘에게 우수한 재생력을 부여합니다.
5. 예지는 피해 감소를 향상시킵니다.
6. 대규모 가속은 영구적인 가속 효과를 제공합니다.
7. 진실 보기는 영구적인 진실 보기 효과를 제공합니다.
8. 연쇄 번개는 골렘이 적에게 맞을 때마다 번개를 방출하게 합니다.
9. 모르덴카이넨의 분리는 골렘이 적을 칠 때마다 마법 해제 능력을 부여합니다.

이 주문들을 각 도관에 배치함으로써, 골렘의 속성과 능력을 창조자의 정확한 사양에 맞게 맞춤화할 수 있습니다.
