31630,Dialog,WYVRN,I surrender!,"항복한다!",M2Q1A08WYVRN,m2q2atwyv3,,,vs_nrangem1_063,0,0
31631,Dialog,WYVRN,You have made short work of my creatures. 'Twould not be wise to let you do the same to me.,"내 짐승들을 순식간에 해치웠군. 나한테도 덤비겠다면 후회할 거다.",M2Q1A08WYVRN,nw_d1_j_surr01,,,vs_nrangem1_064,0,0
31632,Dialog,WYVRN,"Ha! It seems another fool has taken my bait! Kill them all, my creatures!","하! 또 다른 바보가 내 미끼에 걸린 것 같군! 모두 죽여라, 내 짐승들이여!",M2Q1A08WYVRN,m2q2atwyv2,,,vs_nrangem1_062,0,0
31633,Dialog,WYVRN,"If it must be this way, I shall not fall easily! Die!","이렇게 될 수밖에 없다면, 쉽게 쓰러지진 않겠다! 죽어라!",M2Q1A08WYVRN,nw_d1_attonend02,,,,0,0
31634,Dialog,WYVRN,"Please, you must help me!","제발, 도와줘야 해!",M2Q1A08WYVRN,,,,vs_nrangem1_061,0,0
31635,Dialog,WYVRN,I have already lost a fellow ranger to the animals in this place. He lies just down the southern path.,"이 장소의 동물들에게 동료 순찰자를 이미 잃었어. 남쪽 길 아래에 쓰러져 있지.",M2Q1A08WYVRN,,,,vs_nrangem1_065,0,0
31636,Dialog,WYVRN,"Wyvern, formerly a 'guest' of the Bulwark Prison in Waterdeep, at your service.","와이번, 예전에 워터딥의 성채 감옥 '손님'이었지. 도움이 되어주마.",M2Q1A08WYVRN,,,,,0,0
31637,Dialog,WYVRN,It was nothing personal. I thought that you might be a bounty hunter looking to kill me or take me back to that hellish dungeon.,"개인적인 감정은 없었어. 현상금 사냥꾼이 날 죽이거나 그 지옥 같은 감옥으로 끌고 가려는 줄 알았거든.",M2Q1A08WYVRN,,,,,0,0
31638,Dialog,WYVRN,"I would sooner kill myself then go back to that horrible prison! For ten years I felt not the sun on my face nor heard the call of wild. I am a ranger and for me, it was truly hell.","그 끔찍한 감옥으로 돌아가느니 차라리 스스로 목숨을 끊겠어! 10년 동안 햇살도, 야생의 부름도 느끼지 못했지. 난 순찰자야. 진짜 지옥이었어.",M2Q1A08WYVRN,,,,,0,0
31639,Dialog,WYVRN,Now I am free and back where I belong. I want nothing more than to be left alone and never again shall the rank stench of so-called civilization assail my senses.,"이제 난 자유고 내가 있어야 할 곳으로 돌아왔어. 그냥 혼자 내버려 두기만 하면 돼. 문명이라는 역겨운 악취, 다시는 맡고 싶지 않아.",M2Q1A08WYVRN,,,,,0,0
31640,Dialog,WYVRN,"I was born in a forest to the east. My father was a ranger of some renown and he taught me to love the forest and all of the creatures within it. Life was idyllic, though it did not last.","동쪽 숲에서 태어났지. 아버지는 꽤 유명한 순찰자였고, 숲과 그 안의 모든 생명체를 사랑하라고 가르쳐주셨어. 목가적인 삶이었지만 오래가진 않았어.",M2Q1A08WYVRN,,,,,0,0
31641,Dialog,WYVRN,There is a bounty on myself and the four who escaped with me. Hear me out and perhaps you may profit from it.,"나와 함께 탈출한 네 명에게 현상금이 걸려 있어. 내 얘기를 들으면 이득이 될지도 몰라.",M2Q1A08WYVRN,,,,,0,0
31642,Dialog,WYVRN,"I escaped with the aid of other inmates Yesgar, Stirge, Zor, and Delilah. Typically, they were not the type I would associate with, but I was desperate to escape.","다른 수감자들인 예스가르, 스터지, 조르, 딜라일라의 도움으로 탈출했지. 보통이라면 어울릴 부류가 아니지만 탈출이 절박했거든.",M2Q1A08WYVRN,,,,,0,0
31643,Dialog,WYVRN,"I could not stand being in that cell, locked away from nature. I don't regret my actions and did not deserve to be caged.","그 감방에 갇혀 자연과 단절된 삶을 견딜 수 없었어. 후회는 없어. 난 갇힐 짓을 하지 않았거든.",M2Q1A08WYVRN,,,,,0,0
31644,Dialog,WYVRN,Indeed! This need not end in battle. Perhaps you'll allow me to make a suggestion? The bounty is for my ear.,"그렇지! 싸움으로 끝날 필요 없어. 제안을 하나 해도 될까? 현상금은 내 귀에 걸린 거야.",M2Q1A08WYVRN,,,,,0,0
31645,Dialog,WYVRN,"I'll give you my ear if you'll allow me to leave. Tell them I'm dead, and let me become a recluse. I'll go into the wild and never return.","날 보내준다면 내 귀를 주지. 그들에게 내가 죽었다고 말하고, 은둔자가 되게 해줘. 야생으로 들어가서 다시는 돌아오지 않을 거야.",M2Q1A08WYVRN,,,,,0,0
31646,Dialog,WYVRN,"Here, this arrow tip be sharp enough... Szzhgah, that stings... There, a single ear. Don't spend it all in one place.","자, 이 화살촉 날카롭겠지... 으윽, 따끔하네... 자, 귀 한쪽이야. 아껴 써.",M2Q1A08WYVRN,m2q2wyvern002,,,,0,0
31647,Dialog,WYVRN,"Then I'll get it over with. This arrow tip be sharp enough... Szzhgah, that stings... There, take the ear and claim your bounty.","그럼 빨리 끝내지. 이 화살촉 날카롭겠지... 으윽, 따끔하네... 자, 귀를 가져가서 현상금 받아.",M2Q1A08WYVRN,m2q2wyvern002,,,,0,0
31648,Dialog,WYVRN,"As for my partners, I barely spoke to most of them. However, I do know that Zor is an idiot and has likely drowned himself in an ale barrel at the Green Griffon Inn. It was to be his first stop.","동료들? 대부분과는 거의 말도 안 했어. 다만 조르가 멍청이라 푸른 그리핀 여관에서 맥주에 절어 있을 거라는 건 알아. 거기가 첫 번째 목적지였거든.",M2Q1A08WYVRN,,,,,0,0
31649,Dialog,WYVRN,"Now, if you don't mind, I've got a poultice to prepare for where my ear used to be.","자, 이만 가봐. 귀가 있던 자리에 습포제를 붙여야 하거든.",M2Q1A08WYVRN,,,,,0,0
31650,Dialog,WYVRN,"I will not be returned to that prison. If I am to die, it will be right here, amidst the trees. Come kill me, if you can!","저 감옥으로 돌아가진 않아. 죽어야 한다면 바로 여기서, 나무들 사이에서 죽겠어. 죽일 수 있다면 와봐!",M2Q1A08WYVRN,nw_d1_attonend02,,,,0,0
31651,Dialog,WYVRN,I do not wish to die. The bounty requires only that you bring back my ear. I can also assist you in finding one of the other escapees.,"죽고 싶지 않아. 현상금은 내 귀만 가져가면 돼. 다른 탈옥자 중 한 명을 찾는 걸 도와줄 수도 있어.",M2Q1A08WYVRN,,,,,0,0
31652,Dialog,WYVRN,"Men came to the forest. Human mercenaries on leave from their employ with the lord of the human lands west of the forest. They burned part of the forest, slaughtered the animals for sport, and crucified my father on a tree when he came to speak with them.","인간들이 숲에 왔어. 숲 서쪽 영지의 영주 밑에서 일하던 용병들이었지. 숲 일부를 불태우고, 재미로 동물들을 학살하고, 대화하러 온 아버지를 나무에 못 박았어.",M2Q1A08WYVRN,,,,,0,0
31653,Dialog,WYVRN,"When my father did not return, my mother went to search for him. I found her dead at the foot of the tree where my father hung. She had been... brutalized before they killed her. ","아버지가 돌아오지 않자 어머니가 찾으러 갔어. 아버지가 매달린 나무 밑에서 어머니가 죽어 있는 걸 발견했지. 죽이기 전에... 짐승처럼 폭행했더군.",M2Q1A08WYVRN,,,,,0,0
31654,Dialog,WYVRN,"My father still lived and had watched, helpless, as my mother was killed. He died in my arms and I swore vengeance. ","아버지는 아직 살아서 무력하게 어머니가 죽는 걸 지켜보셨어. 내 품에서 숨을 거두셨고, 나는 복수를 맹세했지.",M2Q1A08WYVRN,,,,,0,0
31655,Dialog,WYVRN,"I hunted them down. One by one I found them and killed them. I killed their families. I killed their dogs and their horses, stupid beasts that remained loyal to these men despite what they had done.","그들을 사냥했어. 하나씩 찾아내 죽였지. 그들의 가족도 죽였어. 그들의 개와 말도 죽였어, 그들이 한 짓에도 불구하고 그 인간들에게 충성한 어리석은 짐승들이었지.",M2Q1A08WYVRN,,,,,0,0
31656,Dialog,WYVRN,"When the human lord brought his forces against me, I disappeared into the woods and picked the men off with arrows until the survivors were so afraid of the forest, they called it haunted.","인간 영주가 군대를 이끌고 왔을 때, 숲속으로 사라져서 화살로 하나씩 쓰러뜨렸지. 생존자들이 숲을 너무 무서워해서 귀신 나온다고 했을 정도야.",M2Q1A08WYVRN,,,,,0,0
31657,Dialog,WYVRN,I was betrayed by one of my own. A ranger who they hired from the west. He tracked me down and would not listen to reason. He talked of innocents killed and vengeance gone too far. He did not understand.,"동족 중 한 명에게 배신당했어. 그들이 서쪽에서 고용한 순찰자였지. 날 추적했는데 내 말을 들으려 하지 않더군. 무고한 사람들이 죽었다, 복수가 너무 지나쳤다고 했어. 이해하지 못하는 거야.",M2Q1A08WYVRN,,,,,0,0
31658,Dialog,WYVRN,"I was captured and taken to the prison. There was no trial and only through the intervention of the ranger was I not killed outright. ","붙잡혀서 감옥에 끌려갔어. 재판도 없었고, 그 순찰자가 개입한 덕분에 즉시 처형되진 않았지.",M2Q1A08WYVRN,,,,,0,0
31659,Dialog,WYVRN,But that was many years ago and the rage has long since faded. My father was avenged and I only wish to travel the wilds and never see another settlement again.,"하지만 그건 오래전 일이고 분노도 사라졌어. 아버지의 복수는 끝났고, 이제 야생을 떠돌며 정착지를 다시 보지 않길 바랄 뿐이야.",M2Q1A08WYVRN,,,,,0,0
31660,Dialog,WYVRN,I thank you for my life. Farewell.,"내 목숨을 살려줘서 고맙네. 안녕.",M2Q1A08WYVRN,,,,,0,0
31661,Dialog,WYVRN,"You have what you want, just leave me be.","원하는 건 가졌으니 날 내버려 둬.",M2Q1A08WYVRN,,,,vs_nrangem1_060,0,0
