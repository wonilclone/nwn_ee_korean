23036,Dialog,MTLY,"Other than legions of undead, a husband that puts his cart ahead of his family, and a plague that seems almost apocalyptic?","언데드 군단, 가족보다 수레를 더 챙기는 남편, 거의 세상 종말 같은 역병 말고요?",M1Q5A07MTLY,,,,,0,0
23037,Dialog,MTLY,"Nope, nothing. really. I've been too busy trying to stay alive.","아뇨, 정말 아무것도요. 살아남느라 너무 바빴거든요.",M1Q5A07MTLY,,,,,0,0

23039,Dialog,MTLY,"We'll be all right. Aldo will keep us safe. He's a good man. A bit too attached to the cart, I think, but a good man.","괜찮을 거예요. 알도가 우릴 지켜줄 거예요. 좋은 사람이에요. 수레에 좀 너무 집착하긴 하지만, 좋은 사람이에요.",M1Q5A07MTLY,,,,,0,0

23047,Dialog,MTLY,"Travel, you said. Move to the big city, you said.","여행하자고 했잖아. 대도시로 이사하자고 했잖아.",M1Q5A07MTLY,,,,vs_nhalflf1_050,0,0
23048,Dialog,MTLY,"As... thoughtful... as your offer is, I think I'll stay with my husband. He can form sentences.","제안은... 사려 깊긴... 한데, 남편 곁에 있을게요. 그 사람은 문장은 만들 줄 아니까.",M1Q5A07MTLY,,,,,0,0
23049,Dialog,MTLY,"You know, my old hound had that exact look on his face. All the time. Don't get me wrong, he was a SMART dog... ","있잖아요, 우리 집 늙은 사냥개가 딱 저런 표정이었어요. 항상. 오해 마세요, 똑똑한 개였거든요...",M1Q5A07MTLY,,,,,0,0
23050,Dialog,MTLY,"In answer to your masterfully constructed question, I have seen zombies, plague, and the madness of my husband. Danger enough?","훌륭하게 구성된 질문에 답하자면, 좀비, 역병, 그리고 미친 남편을 봤어요. 충분히 위험하죠?",M1Q5A07MTLY,,,,,0,0

23055,Dialog,MTLY,"Well, my name is Mattily. As for why I am out here, that's a very good question. Why don't you ask the cart?","제 이름은 매틸리예요. 왜 여기 있냐고요, 아주 좋은 질문이네요. 수레한테 물어보시죠?",M1Q5A07MTLY,,,,,0,0
23057,Dialog,MTLY,"I'm sorry for my stressed tone, but I'm growing tired of waiting for a wagon wheel in a zombie-infested street. You hear me, Aldo?!","짜증 섞인 말투는 죄송해요, 하지만 좀비 가득한 거리에서 수레바퀴 기다리는 것도 지치거든요. 들려요, 알도?!",M1Q5A07MTLY,,,,,0,0
23058,Dialog,MTLY,"Save it, Aldo! I'm getting real tired of waiting for a wagon wheel in the middle of a zombie-infested street!","됐어, 알도! 좀비 가득한 거리 한복판에서 수레바퀴 기다리는 거 진짜 지쳤다고!",M1Q5A07MTLY,,,,,0,0
23059,Dialog,MTLY,"I'm more concerned about finding Hector. Aldo sent him for wagon parts and I'm worried for his safety. Family friend, you understand.","헥터 찾는 게 더 걱정이에요. 알도가 수레 부품 구하러 보냈는데 안전이 걱정돼요. 가족 친구거든요, 아시죠.",M1Q5A07MTLY,,,,,0,0
23060,Dialog,MTLY,"Oh, I'm sure we'll be fine. I see you have Hector with you. Now that he's here, we'll be all right. I was worried about him. Aldo! Look! It's Hector!","아, 이제 괜찮을 거예요. 헥터가 같이 있네요. 왔으니 이제 괜찮을 거예요. 걱정했거든요. 알도! 봐! 헥터야!",M1Q5A07MTLY,,,,,0,0

62934,Dialog,MTLY,"Not nice enough to make up for my husband Aldo being dead and zombies crawling out of everywhere, but you know how it goes.","남편 알도가 죽고 좀비가 사방에서 기어 나오는 걸 상쇄할 만큼은 아니지만, 뭐 어쩌겠어요.",M1Q5A07MTLY,,,,,0,0
62935,Dialog,MTLY,Take your insults somewhere else. I've watched undead slaughter my husband - don't think I'll get scared of little old you. I don't need your help.,"모욕은 다른 데 가서 하세요. 언데드가 남편을 죽이는 걸 봤어요 - 당신한테 겁먹을 것 같아요? 도움 필요 없어요.",M1Q5A07MTLY,,,,,0,0
62936,Dialog,MTLY,"Well, since you've got Hector with you, there's less than nothing keeping me here. I mean, I'd hate to leave the beloved cart behind... so many conflicting emotions...","글쎄, 헥터가 같이 있으니, 여기 있을 이유가 전혀 없네요. 사랑하는 수레를 두고 가기 싫긴 한데... 복잡한 감정이...",M1Q5A07MTLY,am1q5aldoflee,,,,0,0
62937,Dialog,MTLY,"That was a joke. Thanks for the offer, but Hector and I can find our own way out from here. I appreciate your help, though. Do me a favor? Spit on the cart before you go. There's a good <boy/girl>.","농담이에요. 제안은 고맙지만, 헥터랑 저는 알아서 나갈게요. 도움은 고마워요. 부탁 하나 들어줄래요? 가기 전에 수레에 침 좀 뱉어주세요. 착한 <boy/girl>.",M1Q5A07MTLY,,,,,0,0
62938,Dialog,MTLY,"As much as I'd like you to, my husband was waiting for Hector and... well, I'd like to know he's safe before I go running off. He's a family friend, and more important than the cart, if you ask me.","그러고 싶지만, 남편이 헥터를 기다리고 있었고... 뭐, 도망가기 전에 무사한지 알고 싶어요. 가족 친구고, 저한테 물으면 수레보다 중요하거든요.",M1Q5A07MTLY,,,,,0,0
62941,Dialog,MTLY,"I see that. Well, he can look all he wants, he's not going to find him. Aldo died fighting for his beloved cart. The idiot.","알아요. 글쎄, 아무리 찾아봐도 못 찾을 거예요. 알도는 사랑하는 수레를 위해 싸우다 죽었어요. 바보같이.",M1Q5A07MTLY,,,,,0,0
62942,Dialog,MTLY,"I am Mattily, and that cart is why I've waited here, and why my husband is dead. Frankly, I don't know why I'm here now. Zombies everywhere else, maybe.","저는 매틸리고, 저 수레 때문에 여기서 기다렸고, 남편이 죽었어요. 솔직히, 왜 아직 여기 있는지 모르겠어요. 다른 데는 좀비 투성이라서 그런가.",M1Q5A07MTLY,,,,,0,0
62943,Dialog,MTLY,"Of course, if my husband would get us the heck out of here, it would be even nicer.","물론, 남편이 여기서 빨리 빼내줬으면 더 좋았겠지만.",M1Q5A07MTLY,,,,,0,0
66886,Dialog,MTLY,"You know, thanks for the offer, but I think I'll make a run for it on my own. With Aldo gone, I don't see any point in staying. I was waiting for Hector... but he's probably dead.","있잖아요, 제안은 고맙지만, 혼자 도망갈게요. 알도가 없으니, 있을 이유가 없어요. 헥터를 기다렸는데... 아마 죽었겠죠.",M1Q5A07MTLY,am1q5aldoflee,,,,0,0
68054,Dialog,MTLY,"Thanks for the offer, but I'm going off on my own. People have been steering me wrong all night.","제안은 고맙지만, 혼자 갈게요. 밤새 사람들한테 잘못된 방향만 들었거든요.",M1Q5A07MTLY,,,,,0,0
